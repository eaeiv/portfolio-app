    bio: [
      "I am a motivated Software Engineer with a wide range of development experience. My work experience has made me adept at designing and rapidly prototyping solutions to meet tight deadlines and exceed expectations. I pride myself on my skill as an individual contributor and team collaborator who highly regards constructive criticism and diversity of perspective. As a zealot for growth, innovation, and optimization, I carry my work ethic into all matters, both personal and professional.",
      "In my free time, I prioritize training my mind and body. While I am a big fan of the classics, lately I have been reading philosophical books focused on the refinement of the body and fostering the warrior's spirit. \"Sun & Steel\" and the \"Hagakure\" have been two of my recent favorites. I take my fitness very seriously and constantly experiment with my diet and fitness regimen. I've run the gauntlet from bodybuilding to powerlifting, but have recently shifted my focus to what I consider the fundamental elements of general athletism: strength, mobility, coordination, and conditioning. The latter three often go overlooked but can easily be incorperated into any training routine. I began practicing Muay Thai to address these overlooked elements and revel in the competition it provides.",
